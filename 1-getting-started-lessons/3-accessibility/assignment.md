# Analyze an inaccessible site

## Instructions

Identify a website that you believe is NOT accessible and create an action plan to improve its accessibility.
Your first task would be to identify this site, detail the ways in which you think it is inaccessible without using analytical tools, and then submit it to a Lighthouse analysis. Capture a pdf of the results of this analysis and outline a detailed plan with a minimum of ten points showing how the site could be improved.

## Table to test site accessibility

|----------|-----------|----------|----------------|
|          | missing <10% of what is required | missing 20% of what is required | missing 50% of what is required |
