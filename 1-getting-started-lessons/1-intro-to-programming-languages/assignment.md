# Reading the Docs

## Instructions

There are many tools that a web developer may need that are on the [MDN documentation for client-side tooling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Overview). Select 3 tools not covered in the lesson, explain why a web developer would use it, and search for a tool that falls under this category and share its documentation. Do not use the same tool example on MDN docs.

Perfect! Thanks for the link — that page on MDN lists a bunch of client-side tools used in web development (like build tools, linters, package managers, etc.).

You're supposed to choose 3 tools that were not covered in your class, and for each one:

Find it in that MDN list (or something similar from the category).

Explain what the tool is.

Explain why a web developer would use it.

That’s how you get the “Exemplary” grade in your rubric!

✅ Here’s an example structure for your assignment using 3 tools:
1. Parcel (Bundler Tool)
What it is:
Parcel is a web application bundler that automatically transforms, bundles, and optimizes your code without needing a config file.

Why a web developer would use it:
A web developer would use Parcel to speed up their development process by letting the tool handle tasks like minification, bundling assets, and hot module reloading — all with minimal setup. It’s great for beginners and small-to-medium projects.

2. PostCSS (CSS Tooling)
What it is:
PostCSS is a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. It can lint your CSS, add vendor prefixes, and even let you use future CSS features.

Why a web developer would use it:
Developers use PostCSS to improve and future-proof their CSS, ensuring better browser compatibility and reducing manual work. It helps write cleaner and more modern CSS.

Documentation:
https://postcss.org

3. Browsersync (Development Tool)
What it is:
Browsersync is a development tool that automatically reloads your browser when files change — and it syncs across multiple devices in real time.

Why a web developer would use it:
It’s great for testing responsive designs across devices. A developer can instantly see changes across multiple screens without manually refreshing. This speeds up development and ensures consistency.
