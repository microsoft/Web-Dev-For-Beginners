# Web Development for Beginners - A Curriculum

Learn the fundamentals of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML with our comprehensive 12-week course, brought to you by Microsoft Cloud Advocates. Each of the 24 lessons includes pre- and post-lesson quizzes, detailed written instructions, solutions, assignments, and much more. With a project-based approach to learning, our curriculum is designed to help you develop practical skills through hands-on building. Enhance your skills and optimize your knowledge retention with our effective project-based pedagogy.

### _Are you a student?_

Visit [**Student Hub page**](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/student-hub/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) where you will find beginner resources, Student packs and even ways to get a free certificate voucher. This is the page you want to bookmark and check from time to time as we switch out content monthly.

# Getting Started

> **Teachers**, we have [included some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum. We'd love your feedback [in our discussion forum](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/discussions/categories/teacher-corner)!

> **[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon)**, to fully benefit from this curriculum, we encourage you to fork the entire repository and engage in self-study. Start with a pre-lecture quiz and follow through with reading the lecture material and completing the various activities. Emphasize on comprehending the lessons rather than just copying the solution code. However, if needed, the solution code can be found in the */solutions folders* within each project-based lesson. Another great way to enhance your learning experience is to form a study group with your peers and work through the curriculum together. To further your education, we highly recommend exploring [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/users/wirelesslife/collections/p1ddcy5jwy0jkm?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) for additional study materials..

## Pedagogy

Our curriculum is designed with two key pedagogical principles in mind: project-based learning and frequent quizzes. The program teaches the fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as the latest tools and techniques used by today's web developers. Students will have the opportunity to develop hands-on experience by building a typing game, virtual terrarium, eco-friendly browser extension, space-invader-style game, and a banking app for businesses. By the end of the series, students will have gained a solid understanding of web development.

> 🎓 You can take the first few lessons in this curriculum as a [Learn Path](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/web-development-101/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) on Microsoft Learn!

By ensuring that the content aligns with projects, the process is made more engaging for students and retention of concepts will be augmented. We also wrote several starter lessons in JavaScript basics to introduce concepts, paired with a video from the "[Beginners Series to: JavaScript](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-JavaScript/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon)" collection of video tutorials, some of whose authors contributed to this curriculum.

In addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and can be taken in whole or in part. The projects start small and become increasingly complex by the end of the 12-week cycle.

While we have purposefully avoided introducing JavaScript frameworks to concentrate on the basic skills needed as a web developer before adopting a framework, a good next step to completing this curriculum would be learning about Node.js via another collection of videos: "[Beginner Series to: Node.js](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-Nodejs/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon)".

## Each lesson includes:

- optional sketchnote
- optional supplemental video
- pre-lesson warmup quiz
- written lesson
- for project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project
- knowledge checks
- a challenge
- supplemental reading
- assignment
- post-lesson quiz

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are contained [in this app](https://ashy-river-0debb7803.1.azurestaticapps.net/), for 48 total quizzes of three questions each. They are linked from within the lessons but the quiz app can be run locally; follow the instruction in the `quiz-app` folder. They are gradually being localized.
