# Data Types Practice: E-commerce Shopping Cart

## Instructions

Imagine you are building a modern e-commerce shopping cart system. This assignment will help you understand how different JavaScript data types work together to create real-world applications.

### Your Task

Create a comprehensive analysis of how you would use JavaScript data types in a shopping cart application. For each of the seven primitive data types and objects, you need to:

1. **Identify** the data type and its purpose
2. **Explain** why this data type is the best choice for specific shopping cart features
3. **Provide** realistic code examples showing the data type in action
4. **Describe** how this data type interacts with other parts of the shopping cart

### Required Data Types to Cover

**Primitive Data Types:**
- **String**: Product names, descriptions, user information
- **Number**: Prices, quantities, tax calculations
- **Boolean**: Item availability, user preferences, cart status
- **Null**: Intentionally empty values (like missing discount codes)
- **Undefined**: Uninitialized values or missing data
- **Symbol**: Unique identifiers (advanced use)
- **BigInt**: Large financial calculations (advanced use)

**Reference Types:**
- **Object**: Product details, user profiles, cart contents
- **Array**: List of products, order history, categories

### Example Format for Each Data Type

For each data type, structure your response like this:

```markdown
## [Data Type Name]

**Purpose in Shopping Cart:** [Explain what this data type does]

**Why This Type:** [Explain why this is the best choice]

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Your realistic code example here
```

**Real-world Usage:** [Describe how this would work in practice]

**Interactions:** [Explain how this data type works with others]
```

### Bonus Challenges

1. **Type Coercion**: Show an example where JavaScript automatically converts between data types in your shopping cart (e.g., string "5" + number 10)

2. **Data Validation**: Demonstrate how you would check if user input is the correct data type before processing

3. **Performance Considerations**: Explain when you might choose one data type over another for performance reasons

### Submission Guidelines

- Create a markdown document with clear headings for each data type
- Include working JavaScript code examples
- Use realistic e-commerce scenarios in your examples
- Explain your reasoning clearly for beginners to understand
- Test your code examples to ensure they work correctly

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary (90-100%) | Proficient (80-89%) | Developing (70-79%) | Needs Improvement (Below 70%) |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **Data Type Coverage** | All 7 primitive types and objects/arrays covered with detailed explanations | 6-7 data types covered with good explanations | 4-5 data types covered with basic explanations | Fewer than 4 data types or minimal explanations |
| **Code Examples** | All examples are realistic, working, and well-commented | Most examples work and are relevant to e-commerce | Some examples work but may be generic | Code examples are incomplete or non-functional |
| **Real-world Application** | Clearly connects each data type to practical shopping cart features | Good connection to e-commerce scenarios | Some connection to shopping cart context | Limited real-world application demonstrated |
| **Technical Accuracy** | All technical information is correct and demonstrates deep understanding | Most technical information is accurate | Generally accurate with minor errors | Contains significant technical errors |
| **Communication** | Explanations are clear, beginner-friendly, and well-organized | Good explanations that are mostly clear | Explanations are understandable but may lack clarity | Explanations are unclear or poorly organized |
| **Bonus Elements** | Includes multiple bonus challenges with excellent execution | Includes one or more bonus challenges well done | Attempts bonus challenges with mixed success | No bonus challenges attempted |

### Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:
- ✅ **Understand** the seven JavaScript primitive data types and their uses
- ✅ **Apply** data types to real-world programming scenarios
- ✅ **Analyze** when to choose specific data types for different purposes
- ✅ **Create** working code examples that demonstrate data type usage
- ✅ **Explain** technical concepts in beginner-friendly language
- ✅ **Connect** fundamental programming concepts to practical applications
