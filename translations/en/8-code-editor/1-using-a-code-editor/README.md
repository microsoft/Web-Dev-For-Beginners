Once you‚Äôre comfortable with VSCode.dev, you‚Äôll be ready to tackle coding tasks anytime, anywhere.

***

## Getting Started with VSCode.dev

Visit **[VSCode.dev](https://vscode.dev)**‚Äîno installation or downloads required. Signing in with GitHub unlocks full functionality, including syncing your settings, extensions, and repositories. If prompted, connect your GitHub account.

After loading, your workspace will look like this:

![Default VSCode.dev](../../../../translated_images/default-vscode-dev.5d06881d65c1b3234ce50cd9ed3b0028e6031ad5f5b441bcbed96bfa6311f6d0.en.png)

It has three main sections from left to right:
- **Activity bar:** Icons like üîé (Search), ‚öôÔ∏è (Settings), files, source control, etc.
- **Sidebar:** Changes context based on the selected activity bar icon (defaults to *Explorer* to display files).
- **Editor/code area:** The largest section on the right‚Äîwhere you‚Äôll edit and view code.

Click through the icons to explore features, but return to the _Explorer_ to stay organized.

## Opening a GitHub Repository

### Method 1: From the Editor

1. Go to [VSCode.dev](https://vscode.dev). Click **"Open Remote Repository."**
