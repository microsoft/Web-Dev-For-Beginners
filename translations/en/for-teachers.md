### For Educators

Feel free to use this curriculum in your classroom. It integrates smoothly with GitHub Classroom and popular LMS platforms, and it can also be used as a standalone repository with your students.

### Using GitHub Classroom

To manage lessons and assignments for each cohort, create a separate repository for each lesson so GitHub Classroom can link each assignment individually.

- Fork this repository to your organization.
- Create a dedicated repository for each lesson by extracting each lesson folder into its own repository.
  - Option A: Create empty repositories (one per lesson) and copy the contents of the lesson folder into each.
  - Option B: Use a method that preserves Git history (e.g., splitting a folder into a new repository) if you need to maintain provenance.
- In GitHub Classroom, set up an assignment for each lesson and link it to the corresponding lesson repository.
- Recommended settings:
  - Repository visibility: private for student submissions.
  - Use starter code from the default branch of the lesson repository.
  - Add issue and pull request templates for quizzes and submissions.
  - Optionally configure autograding and tests if your lessons include them.
- Helpful conventions:
  - Repository names like lesson-01-intro, lesson-02-html, etc.
  - Labels: quiz, assignment, needs-review, late, resubmission.
  - Tags/releases for each cohort (e.g., v2025-term1).

Tip: Avoid storing repositories in synced folders (e.g., OneDrive/Google Drive) to prevent Git conflicts on Windows.

### Using Moodle, Canvas, or Blackboard

This curriculum includes importable packages for common LMS workflows.

- Moodle: Use the Moodle upload file [Moodle upload file](../../../../../../../teaching-files/webdev-moodle.mbz) to load the entire course.
- Common Cartridge: Use the Common Cartridge file [Common Cartridge file](../../../../../../../teaching-files/webdev-common-cartridge.imscc) for broader LMS compatibility.
- Notes:
  - Moodle Cloud has limited support for Common Cartridge files. Prefer the Moodle file above, which can also be uploaded into Canvas.
  - After importing, review modules, due dates, and quiz settings to align with your term schedule.

### Using the Repository Directly (Without GitHub Classroom)

If you choose not to use GitHub Classroom, you can run the course directly from this repository.

- Synchronous/online formats (Zoom/Teams):
  - Conduct short mentor-led warmups; use breakout rooms for quizzes.
  - Announce a time window for quizzes; students submit their answers as GitHub Issues.
  - For collaborative assignments, students work in public lesson repositories and submit pull requests.
- Private/asynchronous formats:
  - Students fork each lesson into their own **private** repositories and add you as a collaborator.
  - They submit via Issues (quizzes) and Pull Requests (assignments) on your classroom repository or their private forks.

### Best Practices

- Offer an introductory lesson on Git/GitHub basics, Issues, and Pull Requests.
- Use checklists in Issues for multi-step quizzes/assignments.
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to establish classroom norms.
- Include accessibility notes (alt text, captions) and provide printable PDFs.
- Version your content for each term and freeze lesson repositories after publishing.
