# CSS Refactoring Assignment

## Objective

Refactor the terrarium project to use **Flexbox** or **CSS Grid** for layout. Update the HTML and CSS as needed to achieve a modern, responsive design. You do not need to implement draggable elementsâ€”focus solely on layout and styling.

## Instructions

1. **Create a new version** of the terrarium app. Modify the HTML and CSS to utilize Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout.
2. **Ensure all artwork and elements are properly displayed** as in the original version.
3. **Test your design** in at least two different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
4. **Take screenshots** of your terrarium in each browser to showcase cross-browser compatibility.
5. **Submit** your updated code along with the screenshots.
