# HTML Practice Assignment: Build a Blog Mockup

## Objective

Create and hand-code the HTML structure for a personal blog homepage. This task will help you practice using semantic HTML, planning layouts, and organizing your code.

## Instructions

1. **Design Your Blog Mockup**
   - Draw a visual representation of your blog homepage. Include essential sections like the header, navigation, main content, sidebar, and footer.
   - You can sketch it on paper and scan it, or use digital tools (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD, Canva, or even PowerPoint).

2. **Identify HTML Elements**
   - Make a list of the HTML elements you intend to use for each section (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`–`<h6>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<a>`, etc.).

3. **Write the HTML Markup**
   - Hand-code the HTML for your mockup, focusing on semantic structure and best practices.
   - Use at least 10 different HTML elements.
   - Add comments to explain your choices and structure.

4. **Submit Your Work**
   - Upload your sketch/mockup along with your HTML file.
   - Optionally, write a short reflection (2–3 sentences) about your design decisions.
