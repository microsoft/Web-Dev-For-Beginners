# My Terrarium: A project to learn about HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation using JavaScript 🌵🌱

A small drag-and-drop coding exercise. With a bit of HTML, JS, and CSS, you’ll be able to create a web interface, style it, and even add various interactions of your choice.

The CSS-based terrarium design was inspired by Jakub Mandra's glass jar [codepen](https://codepen.io/Rotarepmi/pen/rjpNZY).

The artwork was hand-drawn by [Jen Looper](http://jenlooper.com) using Procreate.

## Deploy your Terrarium

You can deploy or publish your terrarium on the web using Azure Static Web Apps.

1. Fork this repository.

2. Click this button:

[![Deploy to Azure button](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customportal=false&WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon#create/Microsoft.StaticApp)

3. Follow the wizard to create your app. Make sure to set the app root to either `/solution` or the root of your codebase. This app doesn’t include an API, so you don’t need to add one. A GitHub folder will be created in your forked repository, which will help Azure Static Web Apps' build services to build and publish your app to a new URL.
