# Explore Collisions

## Instructions

Apply your collision detection knowledge by creating a custom mini-game wey show different kain object interactions. Dis assignment go help you sabi collision mechanics through creative implementation and experiment.

### Project requirements

**Make small interactive game wey get:**
- **Plenty moving objects** wey person fit control with keyboard or mouse input
- **Collision detection system** wey use rectangle intersection principles from the lesson
- **Visual feedback** when collisions happen (object destruction, color changes, effects)
- **Game rules** wey make collisions get meaning and dey interesting

### Creative suggestions

**Try do one of these scenarios:**
- **Asteroid field**: Steer ship through dangerous space debris
- **Bumper cars**: Build physics-based collision arena
- **Meteor defense**: Protect Earth from incoming space rocks
- **Collection game**: Gather items and avoid obstacles
- **Territory control**: Objects wey dey compete to claim space

### Technical implementation

**Your solution suppose show:**
- Correct use of rectangle-based collision detection
- Event-driven programming for user input
- Object lifecycle management (creation and destruction)
- Clean code organization wit proper class structure

### Bonus challenges

**Make your game better with extra features:**
- **Particle effects** when collisions happen
- **Sound effects** for different collision types
- **Scoring system** based on collision results
- **Multiple collision types** with different behaviors
- **Progressive difficulty** wey increase over time

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Collision Detection** | Implements accurate rectangle-based collision detection with multiple object types and sophisticated interaction rules | Basic collision detection dey work correct with simple object interactions | Collision detection get wahala or no dey work consistent |
| **Code Quality** | Clean, well-organized code wit proper class structure, meaningful variable names, and correct comments | Code dey work but fit dey better organized or documented | Code hard to understand or no well structured |
| **User Interaction** | Responsive controls wit smooth gameplay, clear visual feedback, and engaging mechanics | Basic controls dey work wit enough feedback | Controls no dey respond or dey confusing |
| **Creativity** | Original concept wit unique features, visual polish, and innovative collision behaviors | Standard implementation wit some creative parts | Basic functionality without creative improvements |
