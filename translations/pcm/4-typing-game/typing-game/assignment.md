# Create new keyboard game

## Instructions

Now wey you don sabi di fundamentals of event-driven programming wit di typing game, na time to show your creativity! You go design and build your own keyboard-based game weh go show say you understand how event handling, DOM manipulation, and user interaction patterns dey work.

Make you create small game weh dey use keyboard events to do specific tasks. E fit be different kind typing game, art app weh dey paint pixels for screen anytime keyboard key press, simple arcade-style game weh you control wit arrow keys, or any other creative idea weh you fit think. Make you use your brain, reason how different keys fit trigger different kain behavior!

**Your game suppose get:**

| Requirement | Description | Purpose |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Event Listeners** | Respond to at least 3 different keyboard events | Show say you sabi event handling |
| **Visual Feedback** | Give immediate visual response to wetin user input | Show say you sabi DOM manipulation |
| **Game Logic** | Get scoring, levels, or progression mechanics | Practice how to implement application state |
| **User Interface** | Clear instructions and easy to use controls | Develop user experience design skills |

**Creative project ideas to consider:**
- **Rhythm Game**: Players press keys to di rhythm of music or visual cues
- **Pixel Art Creator**: Different keys dey paint different colors or patterns
- **Word Builder**: Players dey create words by typing letters for specific order
- **Snake Game**: You fit control snake wit arrow keys to collect items
- **Music Synthesizer**: Different keys dey play different kind musical tones or sounds
- **Speed Typing Variants**: Category-specific typing (programming words, foreign languages)
- **Keyboard Drummer**: Create beats by mapping keys to different drum sounds

**Implementation guidelines:**
- **Start** with simple idea then build complexity gradually
- **Focus** on smooth, responsive controls wey go feel natural
- **Include** clear visual signs for game state and player progress
- **Test** your game wit different people to make sure e easy to play
- **Document** your code wit comments weh explain your event handling plan

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| **Functionality** | Complete, polished game wey get many features and smooth gameplay | Working game with basic features wey show keyboard event handling | Minimal implementation with limited function or serious bugs |
| **Code Quality** | Well-organized, commented code wey follow best practices wit efficient event handling | Clean, readable code with correct use of event listeners and DOM manipulation | Basic code structure with some organization wahala or inefficient implementation |
| **User Experience** | Controls dey easy, feedback clear, gameplay interesting and professional | Functional interface with enough user guidance and responsive controls | Basic interface wey instructions no clear or e no dey responsive well |
| **Creativity** | Original idea wit innovative use of keyboard events and creative problem solving | Interesting variation of common game patterns with good use of event handling | Simple implementation of basic idea wit small creative elements |
