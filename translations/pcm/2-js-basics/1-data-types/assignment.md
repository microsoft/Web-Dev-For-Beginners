# Data Types Practice: E-commerce Shopping Cart

## Instructions

Imagine say you dey build modern e-commerce shopping cart system. Dis assignment go help you understand how different JavaScript data types dey work together to create real-world applications.

### Your Task

Create complete analysis of how you go take use JavaScript data types inside shopping cart application. For each of di seven primitive data types and objects, you need to:

1. **Identify** di data type and wetin e dey do
2. **Explain** why dis data type na di best choice for specific shopping cart features
3. **Provide** realistic code examples wey show di data type for action
4. **Describe** how dis data type dey interact wit oda parts of di shopping cart

### Required Data Types to Cover

**Primitive Data Types:**
- **String**: Product names, descriptions, user information
- **Number**: Prices, quantities, tax calculations
- **Boolean**: Item availability, user preferences, cart status
- **Null**: Intentionally empty values (like missing discount codes)
- **Undefined**: Uninitialized values or missing data
- **Symbol**: Unique identifiers (advanced use)
- **BigInt**: Large financial calculations (advanced use)

**Reference Types:**
- **Object**: Product details, user profiles, cart contents
- **Array**: List of products, order history, categories

### Example Format for Each Data Type

For each data type, structure your response like dis:

```markdown
## [Data Type Name]

**Purpose in Shopping Cart:** [Explain what this data type does]

**Why This Type:** [Explain why this is the best choice]

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Your realistic code example here
```

**Real-world Usage:** [Describe how this go work for practice]

**Interactions:** [Explain how dis data type dey work wit oda ones]
```

### Bonus Challenges

1. **Type Coercion**: Show an example where JavaScript automatically converts between data types in your shopping cart (e.g., string "5" + number 10)

2. **Data Validation**: Demonstrate how you would check if user input is the correct data type before processing

3. **Performance Considerations**: Explain when you might choose one data type over another for performance reasons

### Submission Guidelines

- Create a markdown document with clear headings for each data type
- Include working JavaScript code examples
- Use realistic e-commerce scenarios in your examples
- Explain your reasoning clearly for beginners to understand
- Test your code examples to ensure they work correctly

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary (90-100%) | Proficient (80-89%) | Developing (70-79%) | Needs Improvement (Below 70%) |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **Data Type Coverage** | All 7 primitive types and objects/arrays covered with detailed explanations | 6-7 data types covered with good explanations | 4-5 data types covered with basic explanations | Fewer than 4 data types or minimal explanations |
| **Code Examples** | All examples are realistic, working, and well-commented | Most examples work and are relevant to e-commerce | Some examples work but may be generic | Code examples are incomplete or non-functional |
| **Real-world Application** | Clearly connects each data type to practical shopping cart features | Good connection to e-commerce scenarios | Some connection to shopping cart context | Limited real-world application demonstrated |
| **Technical Accuracy** | All technical information is correct and demonstrates deep understanding | Most technical information is accurate | Generally accurate with minor errors | Contains significant technical errors |
| **Communication** | Explanations are clear, beginner-friendly, and well-organized | Good explanations that are mostly clear | Explanations are understandable but may lack clarity | Explanations are unclear or poorly organized |
| **Bonus Elements** | Includes multiple bonus challenges with excellent execution | Includes one or more bonus challenges well done | Attempts bonus challenges with mixed success | No bonus challenges attempted |

### Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:
- ✅ **Understand** the seven JavaScript primitive data types and their uses
- ✅ **Apply** data types to real-world programming scenarios
- ✅ **Analyze** when to choose specific data types for different purposes
- ✅ **Create** working code examples that demonstrate data type usage
- ✅ **Explain** technical concepts in beginner-friendly language
- ✅ **Connect** fundamental programming concepts to practical applications
