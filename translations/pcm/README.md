## 🏫 Pedagogy

Our curriculum design take two main pedagogy principles seriously:
* project-based learning
* frequent quizzes

Di program dey teach fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, plus di latest tools and techniques wey web developers dey use now. Students go fit develop hands-on experience by building typing game, virtual terrarium, eco-friendly browser extension, space-invader style game, and banking app for businesses. By the end of the course, students go get solid understanding of web development.

> 🎓 You fit take di first few lessons in dis curriculum as [Learn Path](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/web-development-101/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) for Microsoft Learn!

By making sure content match projects, the process go make learning more interesting for students and concepts go remain for mind well well. We also write some starter lessons for JavaScript basics to introduce concepts, plus video from "[Beginners Series to: JavaScript](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-JavaScript/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon)" collection of video tutorials, some authors from the videos join to help design this curriculum.

Plus, low-stakes quiz before class dey set student mindset for learning topic, and second quiz after class make sure say dem remember well. This curriculum na flexible and fun one wey you fit do as whole or part. Projects start small and go get more complex by 12-week cycle end.

Even though we no bother to introduce JavaScript frameworks so that we go focus on basic skills wey web developers need before use framework, good next step after dis curriculum na to learn Node.js with another video series: "[Beginner Series to: Node.js](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-Nodejs/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon)".
