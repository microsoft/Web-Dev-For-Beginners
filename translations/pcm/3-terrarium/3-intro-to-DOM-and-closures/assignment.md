# DOM Element Investigation Assignment

## Overview

Now wey you don experience the power of DOM manipulation for yourself, na time to explore the bigger world of DOM interfaces. Dis assignment go deepen your understanding of how different web technologies dey interact with the DOM beyond just dragging elements.

## Learning Objectives

By completing dis assignment, you go:
- **Research** and sabi one specific DOM interface well-well
- **Analyze** how people dey use DOM manipulation for real life
- **Connect** theory concepts to practical tins wey fit work
- **Develop** skills for technical documentation and analysis

## Instructions

### Step 1: Choose Your DOM Interface

Go check MDN full [list of DOM interfaces](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) and choose one interface wey you like. Try choose from these categories make e get variety:

**Beginner-Friendly Options:**
- `Element.classList` - How to manage CSS classes small-small
- `Document.querySelector()` - Advanced way to select elements
- `Element.addEventListener()` - How to manage events pass pointer events
- `Window.localStorage` - Where you fit store data for client side

**Intermediate Challenges:**
- `Intersection Observer API` - How to detect if element dey visible
- `MutationObserver` - How to watch DOM changes
- `Drag and Drop API` - Another way to do pointer based dragging
- `Geolocation API` - How to get user location

**Advanced Exploration:**
- `Web Components` - Custom elements plus shadow DOM
- `Canvas API` - How to do graphics programmatic
- `Web Workers` - Work for background without disturbing UI
- `Service Workers` - How to make offline functions

### Step 2: Research and Document

Make one deep analysis (300-500 words) wey include:

#### Technical Overview
- **Define** wetin your chosen interface dey do for a simple, beginner-friendly way
- **Explain** the main methods, properties, or events wey e get
- **Describe** the kind problems wey e dey solve

#### Real-World Implementation
- **Find** website wey use your chosen interface (fit inspect the code or research examples)
- **Document** how dem take implement am with code samples if you fit
- **Analyze** why the developers choose that style
- **Explain** how e make user experience beta

#### Practical Application
- **Compare** your interface with the techniques we use last time for the terrarium project
- **Suggest** how your interface fit improve or add beta tins for terrarium
- **Identify** other projects wey dis interface go make sense

### Step 3: Code Example

Put one simple, working code wey go show your interface in action. E suppose be:
- **Functional** - The code go really work if you test am
- **Commented** - Make e explain wetin each part dey do
- **Relevant** - Make e connect to real-life use case
- **Beginner-friendly** - People wey dey learn web dev go fit understand am

## Submission Format

## Assessment Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary (A) | Proficient (B) | Developing (C) | Needs Improvement (D) |
|----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Technical Understanding** | Show deep understanding with correct explanations and proper terms | Show solid understanding with mostly correct explanations | Basic understanding but get small mistakes | No good understanding plus plenty errors |
| **Real-World Analysis** | Identify and analyze real implementation well well with examples | Find real example with okay analysis | Find example but analysis no too deep | Vague or wrong real-world connection |
| **Code Example** | Code wey work plus good comments to show how interface work | Working code with enough comments | Code dey work but need better explanation | Code get errors or explanation no clear |
| **Writing Quality** | Clear, interesting writing with proper structure and technical talk | Well organized with good technical writing | Adequate organization and clarity | No good organization or unclear writing |
| **Critical Thinking** | Make clever connections between ideas and suggest new ways to use interface | Show good thinking plus relevant connections | Small analysis but fit still do more | No much sign of thinking critically |

## Tips for Success

**Research Strategies:**
- **Start** with MDN docs to get correct information
- **Look** for code examples on GitHub or CodePen
- **Check** popular websites using browser dev tools
- **Watch** tutorial videos to see explanations visually

**Writing Guidelines:**
- **Use** your own words, no copy-paste from docs
- **Include** examples and code snippets wey fit explain well
- **Explain** technical things like you dey teach friend
- **Connect** your interface to general web dev concepts

**Code Example Ideas:**
- **Create** small demo wey show main features of your interface
- **Build** on ideas from our terrarium project if e fit
- **Focus** on how e work pass how e look
- **Test** your code to make sure e work well
