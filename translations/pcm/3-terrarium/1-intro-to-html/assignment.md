# HTML Practice Assignment: Build a Blog Mockup

## Learning Objectives

Apply your HTML knowledge by designing and coding a complete blog homepage structure. Dis hand-on assignment go help you sabi semantic HTML concepts, accessibility best practices, and professional code organization skills wey you go dey use throughout your web development journey.

**By completing dis assignment, you go:**
- Practice how to plan website layouts before you start coding
- Use semantic HTML elements well well
- Create accessible, well-structured markup
- Develop professional coding habits with comments and organization

## Project Requirements

### Part 1: Design Planning (Visual Mockup)

**Create visual mockup of your blog homepage wey get:**
- Header with site title and navigation
- Main content area with at least 2-3 blog post previews
- Sidebar with extra information (about section, recent posts, categories)

**Mockup Creation Options:**
- **Hand-drawn sketch**: Use paper and pencil, then take picture or scan your design
- **Digital tools**: Figma, Adobe XD, Canva, PowerPoint, or any drawing app
- **Wireframe tools**: Balsamiq, MockFlow, or any like that wireframing software

**Label your mockup sections** with the HTML elements wey you plan to use (e.g., "Header - `<header>`", "Blog Posts - `<article>`").

### Part 2: HTML Element Planning

**Make list wey go map each section of your mockup to the specific HTML elements:**

```
Example:
- Site Header → <header>
- Main Navigation → <nav> with <ul> and <li>
- Blog Post → <article> with <h2>, <p>, <time>
- Sidebar → <aside> with <section> elements
- Page Footer → <footer>
```

**Required Elements to Include:**
Your HTML must get at least 10 different semantic elements from dis list:

- `<img>`, `<time>`, `<blockquote>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`

### Part 3: HTML Implementation

**Code your blog homepage based on these standards:**

1. **Document Structure**: Include correct DOCTYPE, html, head, and body elements
2. **Semantic Markup**: Use HTML elements for wetin dem suppose represent
3. **Accessibility**: Put correct alt text for images and meaningful link text
4. **Code Quality**: Use consistent indentation and meaningful comments
5. **Content**: Include real blog content (you fit use placeholder text)

**Sample HTML Structure:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">

</body>
</html>
```
