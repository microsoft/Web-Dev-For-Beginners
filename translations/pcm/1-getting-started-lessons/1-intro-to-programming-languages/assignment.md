## Suggested Tool Categories

Try explore tools from these categories:

| Category | Examples | What They Do |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Build Tools** | Vite, Webpack, Parcel, esbuild | Dem bundle and optimize code for production with fast development servers |
| **Testing Frameworks** | Vitest, Jest, Cypress, Playwright | Dem make sure code correct and catch bugs before deployment |
| **Design Tools** | Figma, Adobe XD, Penpot | Dem dey create mockups, prototypes, and design systems together |
| **Deployment Platforms** | Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages | Dem host and distribute websites with automatic CI/CD |
| **Version Control** | GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket | Dem manage code changes, collaboration, and project workflows |
| **CSS Frameworks** | Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Bulma | Dem quicken styling with pre-built component libraries |
| **Package Managers** | npm, pnpm, Yarn | Dem install and manage code libraries and dependencies |
| **Accessibility Tools** | axe-core, Lighthouse, Pa11y | Dem test for inclusive design and WCAG compliance |
| **API Development** | Postman, Insomnia, Thunder Client | Dem dey test and document APIs while development dey happen |

## Format Requirements

**For each tool:**
```
### [Tool Name] - [Category]

**Purpose:** [2-3 sentences explaining why developers use this tool]

**Documentation:** [Official website/documentation link]

**Workflow Integration:** [1 sentence about how it fits into development process]
```

## Quality Guidelines

- **Choose current tools**: Pick tools wey dem still dey maintain and plenty people sabi for 2025
- **Focus on value**: Talk the exact benefits, no be just wetin the tool dey do
- **Professional context**: Think about tools wey development teams dey use, no be only individual hobbyists
- **Diverse selection**: Choose tools from different categories to show wide ecosystem
- **Modern relevance**: Pick tools wey align with current web development trends and best practices

## Rubric

| Excellent | Good | Needs Improvement |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| **Clear explain why developers dey use each tool and which problems e dey solve** | **Explained wetin the tool do but miss some context about e value** | **Only list tools no explain wetin dem dey do or benefits** |
| **Give official documentation links for all tools** | **Mostly give official links but 1-2 tutorial sites dey too** | **Mainly give tutorial sites no official docs** |
| **Pick current, professionally-used tools from wide categories** | **Pick good tools but category variety no too much** | **Choose old tools or only one category** |
| **Show understanding of how tools dey fit into development workflows** | **Show small understanding for professional context** | **Only focus on tool features no workflow context** |

> 💡 **Research Tip**: Try find tools wey dey job postings for web developers, check popular developer surveys, or look through dependencies wey successful open-source projects use for GitHub!
