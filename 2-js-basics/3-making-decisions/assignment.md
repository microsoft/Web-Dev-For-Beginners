# Operators

## Instructions

Play around with operators. Here's a suggestion for a program you can implement:

You have a set of students from two different grading systems.

### First grading system

One grading system is defined as grades being from 1-5 where 3 and above means you pass the course.

### Second grading system

The other grade system has the following grades `A, A-, B, B-, C, C-` where `A` is the top grade and `C` is the lowest passing grade.

### The task

Given the following array `allStudents` representing all students and their grades, construct a new array `studentsWhoPass` containing all students who pass.

> TIP, use a for-loop and if...else and comparison operators:

```javascript
let allStudents = [
  'A',
  'B-',
  1,
  4,
  5,
  2
]

let studentsWhoPass = [];
```
