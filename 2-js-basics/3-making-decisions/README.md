## A Brief Recap on Booleans

Booleans can have only two values: `true` or `false`. Booleans help make decisions on which lines of code should run when certain conditions are met.

Set your boolean to be true or false like this:

`let myTrueBool = true`
`let myFalseBool = false`

âœ… Booleans are named after the English mathematician, philosopher and logician George Boole (1815â€“1864).

## Comparison Operators and Booleans

Operators are used to evaluate conditions by making comparisons that will create a Boolean value. The following is a list of operators that are frequently used.

| Symbol | Description                                                                                                                                                   | Example            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `<`    | **Less than**: Compares two values and returns the `true` Boolean data type if the value on the left side is less than the right                              | `5 < 6 // true`    |
| `<=`   | **Less than or equal to**: Compares two values and returns the `true` Boolean data type if the value on the left side is less than or equal to the right      | `5 <= 6 // true`   |
| `>`    | **Greater than**: Compares two values and returns the `true` Boolean data type if the value on the left side is larger than the right                         | `5 > 6 // false`   |
| `>=`   | **Greater than or equal to**: Compares two values and returns the `true` Boolean data type if the value on the left side is larger than or equal to the right | `5 >= 6 // false`  |
| `===`  | **Strict equality**: Compares two values and returns the `true` Boolean data type if values on the right and left are equal AND are the same data type.       | `5 === 6 // false` |
| `!==`  | **Inequality**: Compares two values and returns the opposite Boolean value of what a strict equality operator would return                                    | `5 !== 6 // true`  |

âœ… Check your knowledge by writing some comparisons in your browser's console. Does any returned data surprise you?

## If Statement

The if statement will run code in between its blocks if the condition is true.

```javascript
if (condition) {
  //Condition is true. Code in this block will run.
}
```

Logical operators are often used to form the condition.

```javascript
let currentMoney;
let laptopPrice;

if (currentMoney >= laptopPrice) {
  //Condition is true. Code in this block will run.
  console.log("Getting a new laptop!");
}
```

## If..Else Statement

The `else` statement will run the code in between its blocks when the condition is false. It's optional with an `if` statement.

```javascript
let currentMoney;
let laptopPrice;

if (currentMoney >= laptopPrice) {
  //Condition is true. Code in this block will run.
  console.log("Getting a new laptop!");
} else {
  //Condition is false. Code in this block will run.
  console.log("Can't afford a new laptop, yet!");
}
```

âœ… Test your understanding of this code and the following code by running it in a browser console. Change the values of the currentMoney and laptopPrice variables to change the returned `console.log()`.

## Switch Statement

The `switch` statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Use the `switch` statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
  // code block
}
```

```javascript
// program using switch statement
let a = 2;

switch (a) {
  case 1:
    a = "one";
    break;
  case 2:
    a = "two";
    break;
  default:
    a = "not found";
    break;
}
console.log(`The value is ${a}`);
```

âœ… Test your understanding of this code and the following code by running it in a browser console. Change the values of the variable a to change the returned `console.log()`.

## Logical Operators and Booleans

Decisions might require more than one comparison, and can be strung together with logical operators to produce a Boolean value.

| Symbol | Description                                                                                     | Example                                                                 |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `&&`   | **Logical AND**: Compares two Boolean expressions. Returns true **only** if both sides are true | `(5 > 6) && (5 < 6 ) //One side is false, other is true. Returns false` |
| `\|\|` | **Logical OR**: Compares two Boolean expressions. Returns true if at least one side is true     | `(5 > 6) \|\| (5 < 6) //One side is false, other is true. Returns true` |
| `!`    | **Logical NOT**: Returns the opposite value of a Boolean expression                             | `!(5 > 6) // 5 is not greater than 6, but "!" will return true`         |

## Conditions and Decisions with Logical Operators

Logical operators can be used to form conditions in if..else statements.

```javascript
let currentMoney;
let laptopPrice;
let laptopDiscountPrice = laptopPrice - laptopPrice * 0.2; //Laptop price at 20 percent off

if (currentMoney >= laptopPrice || currentMoney >= laptopDiscountPrice) {
  //Condition is true. Code in this block will run.
  console.log("Getting a new laptop!");
} else {
  //Condition is true. Code in this block will run.
  console.log("Can't afford a new laptop, yet!");
}
```

### Negation operator

You've seen so far how you can use an `if...else` statement to create conditional logic. Anything that goes into an `if` needs to evaluate to true/false. By using the `!` operator you can _negate_ the expression. It would look like so:

```javascript
if (!condition) {
  // runs if condition is false
} else {
  // runs if condition is true
}
```

### Ternary expressions

`if...else` isn't the only way to express decision logic. You can also use something called a ternary operator. The syntax for it looks like this:

```javascript
let variable = condition ? <return this if true> : <return this if false>
```

Below is a more tangible example:

```javascript
let firstNumber = 20;
let secondNumber = 10;
let biggestNumber = firstNumber > secondNumber ? firstNumber : secondNumber;
```

âœ… Take a minute to read this code a few times. Do you understand how these operators are working?

The above states that

- if `firstNumber` is larger than `secondNumber`
- then assign `firstNumber` to `biggestNumber`
- else assign `secondNumber`.

The ternary expression is just a compact way of writing the code below:

```javascript
let biggestNumber;
if (firstNumber > secondNumber) {
  biggestNumber = firstNumber;
} else {
  biggestNumber = secondNumber;
}
```
