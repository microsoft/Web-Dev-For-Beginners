# Data Types Practice

## Instructions

Imagine you are building a shopping cart. Write documentation on the data types you would need to complete your shopping experience. For each data type, explain how and why you would use it, and provide an example. The six JavaScript data types are: String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, and Object.
