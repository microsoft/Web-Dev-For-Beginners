# Loop an Array

## Instructions

Create a program that lists every 3rd number between 1-20 and prints it to the console.

> TIP: use a for-loop and modify the iteration-expression

## Rubric

``` 
for (let i = 0; i <= 20; i++) {
  if (i % 3 == 0 && i != 0) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```
