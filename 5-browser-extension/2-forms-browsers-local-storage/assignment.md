# Adopt an API

## Instructions

APIs can be very fun to play with. Here is a [list of many free ones](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis). Pick an API, and build a browser extension that solves a problem. It can be as small a problem of not having enough pet pictures (so, try the [dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)) or something bigger - have fun!
