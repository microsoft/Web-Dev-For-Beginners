You’ll learn how to confidently edit code, manage projects, track changes, install extensions, and collaborate like a pro—all from your browser, with zero installation required.

***

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

- Efficiently use a code editor on any project, anywhere
- Seamlessly track your work with built-in version control
- Personalize and boost your development workflow with editor customizations and extensions

***

## Prerequisites

To get started, **sign up for a free [GitHub](https://github.com) account**, which lets you manage code repositories and collaborate worldwide. If you don’t have an account yet, [create one here](https://github.com/).

***

## Why Use a Web-based Code Editor?

A **code editor** like VSCode.dev is your command center for writing, editing, and managing code. With an intuitive interface, tons of features, and immediate access via the browser, you can:

- Edit projects on any device
- Avoid the hassle of installations
- Collaborate and contribute instantly

Once you’re comfortable with VSCode.dev, you’ll be prepared to tackle coding tasks from anywhere, anytime.

***

## Getting Started with VSCode.dev

Navigate to **[VSCode.dev](https://vscode.dev)**—no install, no downloads. Signing in with GitHub unlocks full access, including syncing your settings, extensions, and repositories. If prompted, connect your GitHub account.

After loading, your workspace will look like this:

![Default VSCode.dev](../images/default-vscode-dev has three core sections from left to right:
- **Activity bar:** The icons such as 🔎 (Search), ⚙️ (Settings), files, source control, etc.
- **Sidebar:** Changes context based on the activity bar icon selected (defaults to *Explorer* to show files).
- **Editor/code area:** The largest section to the right—where you’ll actually edit and view code.

Click through the icons to explore features, but return to the _Explorer_ to keep your place.

   - Select the option.
   - Paste your GitHub repo URL (e.g., `https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners`) and hit Enter.

If successful, you’ll see the entire project loaded and ready to edit!

***

### Method 2: Instantly via URL

Transform any GitHub repo URL to open directly in VSCode.dev by replacing `github.com` with `vscode.dev/github`.  
E.g.:

- GitHub: `https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners`
- VSCode.dev: `https://vscode.dev/github/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners`

This feature supercharges quick access to ANY project.
