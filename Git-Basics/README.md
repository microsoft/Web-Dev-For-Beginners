## Basics of GIT for web-dev beginnersðŸ‘¶


## What is `Git`?
      1. Git is a distributed version control system.
      2. The entire codebase and history is available on every developerâ€™s computer, 
         which allows for easy branching and merging.
      3. It is used as Version Control System (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files.
      
* Distributed version control
* Coordinates work between multiple developers  
* Who made what changes and when
* Revert back at any time
* Local & remote repos

## CONCEPTS OF GIT
* Keeps track of code history
* Takes "snapshots" of your files
* You decide when to take a snapshot by making a "commit"
* You can visit any snapshot at any time
* You can stage files before committing
