# CSS Refactoring Assignment

## Objective

Refactor the terrarium project to use **Flexbox** or **CSS Grid** for layout. Update the HTML and CSS as needed to achieve a modern, responsive design. You do not need to implement draggable elementsâ€”focus on layout and styling only.

## Instructions

1. **Create a new version** of the terrarium app. Update the markup and CSS to use Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout.
2. **Ensure the art and elements are in place** as in the original version.
3. **Test your design** in at least two different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
4. **Take screenshots** of your terrarium in each browser to demonstrate cross-browser compatibility.
5. **Submit** your updated code and screenshots.
